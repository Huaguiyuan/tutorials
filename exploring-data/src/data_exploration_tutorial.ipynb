    "In this initial tutorial, you will learn or be reminded of the ways to begin characterizing your dataset. This work is where much of the science happens - understanding what your data set looks like, what data it contains, what features of it connect with others, and what modeling processes might make the most sense for your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read a data set into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "* Determine the size and shape of the data set\n",
    "* Determine if any data are missing from the data set\n",
    "* Plot the distribution (both raw and cumulative) of different variables in the data set\n",
    "* Determine how well distributions of these data fit with known distributions (e.g., Gaussian)\n",
    "* Characterize the relationships between different variables in your data set (i.e., do they covary?)\n",
