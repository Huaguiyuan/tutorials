# Tutorials in machine learning for physics education research
Machine learning is an active field of development that has recently produced many off the shelf innovations in predictive modeling that can be accessible for Physics Education Research. This repository contains beginner tutorials that are grounded in data sets based on physics education data. They provide the language and vocabulary to begin a research project using modern machine learning techniques to perform regressions, classifications, do cluster analysis, and assess model output.

## Workshop learning goals

These notebooks are used for short and long workshops. Short workshop learning goals are much more general, basically, expose you to some aspect of producting machine learning models of data. Longer workshops the learning goals are as follows:

1. Develop an understanding of data visualization in python using libraries such as matplotlib and pandas
2. Understand how to build and assess a regression model
3. Understand how to build and assess a classification model
4. Understand how to build and assess Item Response Theory models
5. Understand how to build and assess unsupervised learning models such as clustering

These notebooks are meant to serve as an introduction to these topics in the context of physics education research. They can act as scaffolding for larger research projects.

# Rules for submitting

1. When committing notebooks please include descriptions of how to use them in the notebooks.
2. R and Python notebooks are accepted. Please use Python 3.x. Python is preferred.
3. If writing Python Please follow PEP-8 where possible. More information on [PEP-8 can be found here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
4. If your Python notebook has library requirements please update the environment.yml file to reflect the new requirements.
5. For new notebooks please create a branch with a relevant title and commit and then merge with the master. This will avoid conflicts for people working on different topics.

If you have questions people are always available on Slack!
